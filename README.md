Lightweight client-side prototype demonstrating structured PRD generation logic.

This tool allows users to input basic feature information and dynamically generate selected PRD sections (Executive Summary, Problem Statement, User Stories, Functional Requirements, Success Metrics).

The goal is to reduce PRD drafting time from hours to minutes through modular, structured generation.

Important Note :

This version simulates structured AI generation logic.

A production version would integrate the API for real-time contextual drafting.
